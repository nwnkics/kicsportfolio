      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project focuses on developing a <strong>real-time autonomous fire and smoke detection system</strong> for indoor environments. It uses advanced deep learning and edge computing to ensure accurate, rapid detection on low-cost devices like the <strong>NVIDIA Jetson Nano</strong>.

      <h3>Custom Dataset Creation</h3>
      <p>
        A comprehensive multi-class dataset was created using <strong>Roboflow</strong>. It includes annotated images for fire, smoke, and neutral indoor scenes. The dataset was formatted for both COCO object detection and classification-based pipelines.

      <h3>Deep Learning Pipeline</h3>
      <p>
        Two transformer-based models were implemented:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>DETR (Detection Transformer):</strong> For bounding-box based fire/smoke detection.</li>
          <li><strong>ViT (Vision Transformer):</strong> For image-level scene classification (fire/smoke/normal).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h3>Temporal Feature Enhancement</h3>
      <p>
        To improve detection in dynamic lighting or moving backgrounds, we extracted <strong>optical flow-based motion features</strong> and fused them with spatial features during model training.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h3>Edge Deployment</h3>
      <p>
        The models were optimized and deployed on an <strong>NVIDIA Jetson Nano</strong>, integrated with both RGB and thermal cameras to enable real-time performance in low-resource edge environments.
      </p>

      <h3>Web-Based Monitoring Dashboard</h3>
      <p>
        A custom dashboard was built using <strong>Django</strong> to monitor system activity. Features include:
        <ul>
          <li>Live video stream with detection overlays</li>
          <li>Real-time incident GPS mapping</li>
          <li>Event logging and automatic alert generation</li>
        </ul>
